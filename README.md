## About
This project is presented at HackNITP 4.0 created by team Hell Peeks.


## Problem Statement
Due to Back to back Covid Waves, and lockdowns, most of the events shifted online and are getting cancelled, due to this actually a industry suffered a lot but no one actually talks about, WhyüôÑ??

That‚Äôs the photography, who suffered a lot of issues out there. The major problem they have got inconsistency in their jobs and unemployability due to lockdowns. No one is giving attention to their problems, and neither government policies govern for their support as they are medium scale industry nor people talks as they don‚Äôt considered to be something talked about. 

It has created a huge vac space in the industry and support for them is something yet to be even talked..
So, it will be too late if we don‚Äôt address this problem Now!!
And our mission is to generalize this problem and create an effective Solution for that 


## Our Motivation
‚ÄúOur purpose of the Solution is to connect the needs of the individuals or Companies to
the Skills they want to hire‚Äù







## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rhythmanand6/photoshop.git
$ cd Photoshop
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ virtualenv2 --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv2`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ cd PhotoHub
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.
